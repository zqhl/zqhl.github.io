title: "New paper accepted to AAAI 2020"
date: 2019-11-14

The 3D crowd counting paper has been accepted to AAAI 2020, 
which was first rejected by ICCV 2019 due to the lack of ablation study on the 3D ground-truth settings.
Later, we added the ablation study and resubmitted the paper to AAAI 2020. 

In AAAI 2020, 7,737 submissions were reviewed and 1,591 accepted "due to space limitations". 
Although this year's acceptance rate of 20.6 percent is higher than last year's 16.2 percent.
